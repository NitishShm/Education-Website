<p>
    Computer is an advanced electronic device that takes raw data as an input from the user and processes it under the control of a set of instructions (called program), produces a result (output), and saves it for future use. This tutorial explains the foundational concepts of computer hardware, software, operating systems, peripherals, etc. along with how to get the most value and impact from computer technology.

    Concept of data and information
</h2>
<p>
    The terms “data” and “information” are often used interchangeably, but they actually aren’t the same. There are subtle differences between these components and their purpose. Data is defined as individual facts, while information is the organization and interpretation of those facts.  

Ultimately, you can use the two components together to identify and solve problems. Below, take a deeper dive into data vs information and how these elements can be applied in a business environment.

<h3>What Is Data?</h3>
<p>
    Data is a raw form of knowledge and, on its own, doesn’t carry any significance or purpose. In other words, you have to interpret data for it to have meaning. Data can be simple—and may even seem useless until it is analyzed, organized, and interpreted.<br>
<br>There are two main types of data:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Quantitative data</strong> is provided in numerical form, like the weight, volume, or cost of an item.</li>
    <li><strong>Qualitative data</strong>is descriptive, but non-numerical, like the name, sex, or eye color of a person.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Is Information?</h3>
<p>
    Information is defined as knowledge gained through study, communication, research, or instruction. Essentially, information is the result of analyzing and interpreting pieces of data. Whereas data is the individual figures, numbers, or graphs, information is the perception of those pieces of knowledge.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For example,</strong> a set of data could include temperature readings in a location over several years. Without any additional context, those temperatures have no meaning. However, when you analyze and organize that information, you could determine seasonal temperature patterns or even broader climate trends. Only when the data is organized and compiled in a useful way can it provide information that is beneficial to others. 
</p>
<h2><strong>The Key Differences Between Data vs Information</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data is a collection of facts, while information puts those facts into context.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>While data is raw and unorganized, information is organized.</strong></li>
    <li><Strong>Data points are individual and sometimes unrelated.</strong> Information maps out that data to provide a big-picture view of how it all fits together.</li>
    <li>Data, on its own, is meaningless. When it’s analyzed and interpreted, it becomes meaningful information.</li>
    <li>Data does not depend on information; however, information depends on data.</li>
    <li>Data typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, or statistics. Information is typically presented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas</li>
    <li>Data isn’t sufficient for decision-making, but you can make decisions based on information.</li>
</ul>
