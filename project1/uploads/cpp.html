                    <h3> What is OOP?</h3>
                    <p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
                    
                    <p>Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform 
                    operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about 
                    creating objects that contain both data and functions.</p>
                    <p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural 
                    programming:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
                      <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
                      <li>OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY &quot;Don't Repeat Yourself&quot;, and makes 
                      the 
                      code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
                      <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable 
                      applications with less code and shorter development time</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The &quot;Don't Repeat Yourself&quot; (DRY) principle is about 
                    reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are 
                    common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them 
                    instead of repeating it.</p>

                    <h2>C++ What are Classes and Objects?</h2>
                    <p>Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.</p>
                    <p>Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and 
                    objects:</p>
                    
                    <div class="flex-container">
                      <div class="box">
                        <h2>class</h2>  
                        <p>Fruit</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="box">
                        <h2>objects</h2>  
                        <p>Apple</p>
                        <p>Banana</p>
                        <p>Mango</p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Another example:</p>
                    <div class="flex-container">
                      <div class="box">
                        <h2>class</h2>  
                        <p>Car</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="box">
                        <h2>objects</h2>  
                        <p>Volvo</p>
                        <p>Audi</p>
                        <p>Toyota</p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.</p>
                    <p>When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the 
                    variables and functions from the class.</p>
