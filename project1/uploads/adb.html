<h2>The Extended Entity Relationship Model</h2>


<p>
    EER is a high-level data model that incorporates the extensions to the original ER model. Enhanced ERD are high level models that represent the requirements and complexities of complex database.</p><p style="">In addition to ER model concepts EE-R includes &minus;

</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li style="">Subclasses and Super classes.</li>
    <li style="">Specialization and Generalization.</li>
    <li style="">Category or union type.</li>
    <li style="">Aggregation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="">
    These concepts are used to create EE-R diagrams.
</p>
<h2 style="">Subclasses and Super class</h2>
<p style="">
    Super class is an entity that can be divided into further subtype.

</p>
<p style="">For <strong>example</strong> &minus; consider Shape super class.</p>

    <p>Super class shape has sub groups: Triangle, Square and Circle.</p><p>Sub classes are the group of entities with some unique attributes.Sub class inherits the properties and attributes from super class.</p><h2 style="">Specialization and Generalization</h2><p style="">Generalization is a process of generalizing an entity which contains generalized attributes or properties of generalized entities.</p><p style=""><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/images/113346-1532408376.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" width="728" height="347"></p><p style="">It is a Bottom up process i.e. consider we have 3 sub entities Car, Truck and Motorcycle. Now these three entities can be generalized into one super class named as Vehicle.</p><p>Specialization is a process of identifying subsets of an entity that share some different characteristic. It is a top down approach in which one entity is broken down into low level entity.</p><p style="">In above example Vehicle entity can be a Car, Truck or Motorcycle.</p><h2 style="">Category or Union</h2><p style="">Relationship of one super or sub class with more than one super class.</p><p style=""><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/images/98917-1532408462.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" width="675" height="251"></p><p style="">Owner is the subset of two super class: Vehicle and House.</p><h2 style="">Aggregation</h2><p style="">Represents relationship between a whole object and its component.</p><p style=""><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/images/133279-1533047715.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" width="691" height="397"></p><p style="">Consider a ternary relationship Works_On between Employee, Branch and Manager. Now the best way to model this situation is to use aggregation, So, the relationship-set, Works_On is a higher level entity-set. Such an entity-set is treated in the same manner as any other entity-set. We can create a binary relationship, Manager, between Works_On and Manager to represent who manages what tasks.</p>
