<h2>Operating systems overview</h2>
<p>An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.</p>
<p>Some popular Operating Systems include Linux Operating System, Windows Operating System, VMS, OS/400, AIX, z/OS, etc.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the computer hardware and controls the execution of all kinds of programs.</p>

<p>Following are some of important functions of an operating System.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Memory Management</li>
<li>Processor Management</li>
<li>Device Management</li>
<li>File Management</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Control over system performance</li>
<li>Job accounting</li> 
<li>Error detecting aids</li>
<li>Coordination between other software and users</li>
</ul>
<h2>Memory Management</h2>
<p>Memory management refers to management of Primary Memory or Main Memory. Main memory is a large array of words or bytes where each word or byte has its own address.</p>
<p>Main memory provides a fast storage that can be accessed directly by the CPU. For a program to be executed, it must in the main memory. An Operating System does the following activities for memory management &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Keeps tracks of primary memory, i.e., what part of it are in use by whom, what part are not in use.</p></li>
<li><p>In multiprogramming, the OS decides which process will get memory when and how much.</p></li>
<li><p>Allocates the memory when a process requests it to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>De-allocates the memory when a process no longer needs it or has been terminated.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Processor Management</h2>
<p>In multiprogramming environment, the OS decides which process gets the processor when and for how much time. This function is called <b>process  scheduling</b>. An Operating System does the following activities for processor management &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Keeps tracks of processor and status of process. The program responsible for this task is known as <b>traffic controller</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process.</p></li>
<li><p>De-allocates processor when a process is no longer required.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Device Management</h2>
<p>An Operating System manages device communication via their respective drivers. It does the following activities for device management &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Keeps tracks of all devices. Program responsible for this task is known as the <b>I/O controller</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Decides which process gets the device when and for how much time.</p></li>
<li><p>Allocates the device in the efficient way.</p></li>
<li><p>De-allocates devices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>File Management</h2>
<p>A file system is normally organized into directories for easy navigation and usage. These directories may contain files and other directions.</p>
<p>An Operating System does the following activities for file management &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Keeps track of information, location, uses, status etc. The collective facilities are often known as <b>file system</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Decides who gets the resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Allocates the resources.</p></li>
<li><p>De-allocates the resources.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Important Activities</h2>
<p>Following are some of the important activities that an Operating System performs &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Security</b> &minus;  By means of password and similar other techniques, it prevents unauthorized access to programs and data.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Control over system performance</b> &minus; Recording delays between request for a service and response from the system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Job accounting</b> &minus; Keeping track of time and resources used by various jobs and users.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Error detecting aids</b> &minus; Production of dumps, traces, error messages, and other debugging and error detecting aids.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Coordination between other softwares and users</b> &minus; Coordination and assignment of compilers, interpreters, assemblers and other software to the various users of the computer systems.</p></li>
</ul>
