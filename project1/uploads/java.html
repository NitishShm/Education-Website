<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p style=text-align:justify><strong>JAVA</strong> was developed by James Gosling at <strong>Sun Microsystems</strong><u> </u>Inc in the year <strong>1995</strong>,&nbsp;later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy.&nbsp;It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java</a> is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to <i>write once run anywhere</i> that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>History: </strong>Java’s history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991.<strong> </strong>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the <strong>Green team </strong>initiated the Java language in 1991. <strong>Sun Microsystems</strong> released its first public implementation in 1996 as <strong>Java 1.0</strong>. It provides no-cost -run-times on popular platforms. Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly comply with its specifications. With the arrival of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.</p><div id=GFG_AD_gfg_mobile_336x280></div><p style=text-align:justify>On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine as free, open-source software. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM’s core code available under open-source distribution terms.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The principles for creating java were simple, robust, secured, high performance, portable, multi-threaded, interpreted, dynamic, etc. In 1995 Java was developed by <strong>James Gosling</strong>, who is known as the Father of Java. Currently, Java is used in mobile devices, internet programming, games, e-business, etc.</p><h3 style=text-align:justify>Java programming language is named JAVA. Why?</h3><p style=text-align:justify>After the name OAK, the team decided to give a new name to it and the suggested words were Silk, Jolt, revolutionary, DNA, dynamic, etc. These all names were easy to spell and fun to say, but they all wanted the name to reflect the essence of technology. In accordance with James Gosling, <strong>Java</strong> the among the top names along with <strong>Silk</strong>, and since java was a unique name so most of them preferred it.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Java is the name of an <strong>island</strong> in Indonesia where the first coffee(named java coffee) was produced. And this name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee near his office. Note that Java is just a name, not an acronym.</p><h3 style=text-align:justify>Java Terminology</h3><p style=text-align:justify>Before learning Java, one must be familiar with these common terms of Java.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>1. &nbsp;Java Virtual Machine(JVM):&nbsp;</strong> This is generally referred to as <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/#:~:text=JVM(Java%20Virtual%20Machine)%20acts,(Write%20Once%20Run%20Anywhere)."><u>JVM</u></a>. There are three execution phases of a program. They are written, compile and run the program.</p><ul><li style=text-align:justify>Writing a program is done by a java programmer like you and me.</li><li style=text-align:justify>The compilation is done by the <strong>JAVAC</strong> compiler which is a primary Java compiler included in the Java development kit (JDK). It takes the Java program as input and generates bytecode as output.</li><li style=text-align:justify>In the Running<strong> </strong>phase of a program,<strong> JVM</strong> executes the bytecode generated by the compiler.</li></ul><p style=text-align:justify>Now, we understood that the function of Java Virtual Machine is to execute the bytecode produced by the compiler. Every Operating System has a different JVM but the output they produce after the execution of bytecode is the same across all the operating systems. This is why Java is known as a<strong> platform-independent language.</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>2. Bytecode in </strong>the <strong>Development process: &nbsp;</strong>As discussed, the Javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. It is saved as <strong>.class</strong> file by the compiler. To view the bytecode, a disassembler like <a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javap-tool-in-java-with-examples/><u>javap</u></a> can be used.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>3. Java Development Kit(JDK): </strong>While we were using the term JDK when we learn about bytecode and JVM. So, as the name suggests, it is a complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers, java docs, etc. For the program to execute in java, we need to install JDK on our computer in order to create, compile and run the java program.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>4. Java Runtime Environment (JRE): </strong>JDK includes JRE. JRE installation on our computers allows the java program to run, however, we cannot compile it. JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet supports, and plugins. For running the java program, a computer needs JRE.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>5. Garbage Collector: </strong>In Java, programmers can’t delete the objects. To delete or recollect that memory JVM has a program called <a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/garbage-collection-java/><u>Garbage Collector</u></a>. Garbage Collectors can recollect the objects that are not referenced. So Java makes the life of a programmer easy by handling memory management. However, programmers should be careful about their code whether they are using objects that have been used for a long time. Because Garbage cannot recover the memory of objects being referenced.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>6. ClassPath: </strong>The <a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classpath-in-java/><u>classpath</u></a> is the file path where the java runtime and Java compiler look for <strong>.class</strong> files to load. By default, JDK provides many libraries. If you want to include external libraries they should be added to the classpath.</p><h3 style=text-align:justify>Primary/Main Features of Java</h3><p style=text-align:justify><strong>1. Platform Independent: &nbsp;</strong>Compiler converts source code to bytecode and then the JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. This bytecode can run on any platform be it Windows, Linux, or macOS which means if we compile a program on Windows, then we can run it on Linux and vice versa. Each operating system has a different JVM, but the output produced by all the OS is the same after the execution of bytecode. That is why we call java a platform-independent language.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>2. Object-Oriented Programming Language: &nbsp;</strong>Organizing the program in the terms of collection of objects is a way of object-oriented programming, each of which represents an instance of the class.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The four main concepts of Object-Oriented programming are:</p><ul><li style=text-align:justify>Abstraction</li><li style=text-align:justify>Encapsulation</li><li style=text-align:justify>Inheritance</li><li style=text-align:justify>Polymorphism</li></ul><p style=text-align:justify><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Simple: &nbsp;</strong>Java is one of the simple languages as it does not have complex features like pointers, operator overloading, multiple inheritances, and Explicit memory allocation.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Robust: &nbsp;</strong>Java language is robust which means reliable. It is developed in such a way that it puts a lot of effort into checking errors as early as possible, that is why the java compiler is able to detect even those errors that are not easy to detect by another programming language. The main features of java that make it robust are garbage collection, Exception Handling, and memory allocation.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Secure:&nbsp;</strong> In java, we don’t have pointers, so we cannot access out-of-bound arrays i.e it shows <strong>ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception</strong> if we try to do so. That’s why several security flaws like stack corruption or buffer overflow are impossible to exploit in Java. Also java programs run in an environment that is independent of the os(operating system) environment which makes java programs more secure .</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Distributed: &nbsp;</strong>We can create distributed applications using the java programming language. Remote Method Invocation and Enterprise Java Beans are used for creating distributed applications in java. The java programs can be easily distributed on one or more systems that are connected to each other through an internet connection.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Multithreading: &nbsp;</strong>Java supports multithreading. It is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of the CPU.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Portable: &nbsp;</strong>As we know, java code written on one machine can be run on another machine. The platform-independent feature of java in which its platform-independent bytecode can be taken to any platform for execution makes java portable.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>9. High Performance:</strong> Java architecture is defined in such a way that it reduces overhead during the runtime and at some time java uses Just In Time (JIT) compiler where the compiler compiles code on-demand basics where it only compiles those methods that are called making applications to execute faster.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>10. Dynamic flexibility: </strong>Java being completely object-oriented gives us the flexibility to add classes, &nbsp;new methods to existing classes and even create new classes through sub-classes. Java even supports functions written in other languages such as C, C++ which are referred to as native methods.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>11. Sandbox Execution:</strong> Java programs run in a separate space that allows user to execute their applications without affecting the underlying system with help of a bytecode verifier. Bytecode verifier also provides additional security as its role is to check the code for any violation of access.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>12. Write Once Run Anywhere:</strong> As discussed above java application generates a &#8216;.class&#8217; file which corresponds to our applications(program) but contains code in binary format. It provides ease t architecture-neutral ease as bytecode is not dependent on any machine architecture. It is the primary reason java is used in the enterprising IT industry globally worldwide.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>13. Power of compilation and interpretation:</strong> Most languages are designed with purpose either they are compiled language or they are interpreted language. But java integrates arising enormous power as Java compiler compiles the source code to bytecode and JVM &nbsp;executes this bytecode to machine OS-dependent executable code.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Example</strong></p><div class=responsive-tabs><h2 class=tabtitle>Java</h2><div class=tabcontent><div class=code-block><div class=code-gutter><div class=editor-buttons-container><div class=editor-buttons><div class=editor-buttons-div title="Run and Edit"><i id=copy-code-button title="Copy Code" class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_copy code-sidebar-button padding-2px copy-code-button"></i></p><div id=run-and-edit-loader class=ring-load></div><p><i id=run-and-edit-button title="Edit Code" lang=java class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_edit_1 padding-2px code-sidebar-button"></i><br><i id=close-code-editor-button title="Close Editor" class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_close-editor padding-2px code-sidebar-button close-code-editor-button"></i></p><div id=run-code-loader class=ring-load></div><p><i id=run-code-button lang=java title="Run Code and See Output" class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_play padding-2px code-sidebar-button"></i></p><div id=generate-url-loader class=ring-load></div><p><i id=generate-url-and-run-button title="Run Code and Generate IDE URL" lang=java class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_link padding-2px code-sidebar-button generate-url-and-run-button"></i><br><i title="Dark Mode" class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_dark-toggle padding-2px code-sidebar-button dark-editor-button"></i><br><i id=edit-on-ide-button title="Edit on IDE" lang=java class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_code padding-2px code-sidebar-button edit-on-ide-button"></i></div></p></div></p></div></p></div><div class=code-container><div id=highlighter_435930 class="syntaxhighlighter nogutter"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tbody><tr><td class=code><div class=container><div class="line number1 index0 alt2"><code class=comments>// Importing classes from packages</code></div><div class="line number2 index1 alt1"><code class=keyword>import</code> <code class=plain>java.io.*;</code></div><div class="line number3 index2 alt2">&nbsp;</div><div class="line number4 index3 alt1"><code class=comments>// Main class</code></div><div class="line number5 index4 alt2"><code class=keyword>public</code> <code class=keyword>class</code> <code class=plain>GFG {</code></div><div class="line number6 index5 alt1">&nbsp;</div><div class="line number7 index6 alt2"><code class="undefined spaces">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code class=comments>// Main driver method</code></div><div class="line number8 index7 alt1"><code class="undefined spaces">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code class=keyword>public</code> <code class=keyword>static</code> <code class=keyword>void</code> <code class=plain>main(String[] args)</code></div><div class="line number9 index8 alt2"><code class="undefined spaces">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code class=plain>{</code></div><div class="line number10 index9 alt1">&nbsp;</div><div class="line number11 index10 alt2"><code class="undefined spaces">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code class=comments>// Print statement</code></div><div class="line number12 index11 alt1"><code class="undefined spaces">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code class=plain>System.out.println(</code><code class=string>"Welcome to GeeksforGeeks"</code><code class=plain>);</code></div><div class="line number13 index12 alt2"><code class="undefined spaces">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code class=plain>}</code></div><div class="line number14 index13 alt1"><code class=plain>}</code></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=code-editor-container></div></p></div><div class=code-output-container><div class=output-block><i id=output-icon title=Output class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_arrow-right-editor padding-2px code-sidebar-button output-icon"></i></p><pre class=output-pre></pre></p></div><div class=ide-link-div><i id=copy-url-button title="Copy Generated Ide URL" class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_copy padding-2px code-sidebar-button copy-url-button"></i></p><pre id=ide-url></pre></p></div></p></div></div></div><div class=code-output><strong>Output</strong></p><pre>Welcone to GeeksforGeeks</pre></div><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>1. &nbsp;Comments: </strong>Comments are used for explaining code and are used in a similar manner in Java or C or C++.

The main<strong>()</strong> method is the entry point of our application.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>6. &nbsp;System.in:</strong> This is the <strong>standard input stream</strong> that is used to read characters from the keyboard or any other standard input device.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>7. &nbsp;System.out: </strong>This is the <strong>standard output stream</strong> that is used to produce the result of a program on an output device like the computer screen.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>8. &nbsp;println(): </strong>This method in Java is also used to display text on the console. It prints the text on the console and the cursor moves to the start of the next line at the console. The next printing takes place from the next line.</p><p style=text-align:justify>9. &nbsp;String []args: This is the argument passed to the main function which is an array of strings with the array name args. One can choose their own flexible name but this name is used by many developers.</p>
