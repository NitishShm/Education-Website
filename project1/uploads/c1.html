    <h2>Components of Computer</h2>
<p>
    A computer device is made up of various elements which help in its effective functioning and processing. There are five basic components of the computer which help in making this processing of data easier and convenient.
 </p>
<p>
    By definition, components of a computer system are the primary elements which make the functioning of an electronic device smooth and faster. There are five basic components which include:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Input Unit</li>
    <li>Output Unit</li>
    <li>Memory Unit</li>
    <li>Control Unit</li>
    <li>Arithmetical and Logical Unit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
    There are several basic components of computer hardware including:
</p>
<h3>1. Central processing unit (CPU)</h3>
<p>
    The CPU controls the computer processes and communicates with the other components of a personal computer. A computer's CPU may be one of the most complicated parts of the computer because of its intricacies. If a computer is experiencing CPU issues, a computer technician may start by checking the fan and cleaning out any dust or debris inside the machine. Another step a computer technician may complete is verifying that power supply cables work. A CPU will not function properly unless it receives a signal from the power supply.
</p>
<h3>2. Motherboard</h3>
<p>
    The motherboard provides the structure for all other components and connects them, while also providing a way to distribute power, deliver information and connect to devices such as a printer or mouse. It controls how data transfers and what type of monitor or screen device to use, for example. It houses the CPU, memory and secondary storage devices such as hard drives.
</p>
<p>
    The first thing that a computer technician may do to troubleshoot any motherboard issues is to take the PC apart and inspect all the connections for corrosion. They may also check the power supply and make sure the computer is receiving electricity. 
</p>
<h3>3. Random Access Memory (RAM)</h3>
<p>
    RAM is where data lives temporarily while it's being actively used by programs, such as when a user launches a computer application. A technician may know how to identify the type of RAM in a computer, how to replace it if it's defective and how to diagnose problems with copying data from one location in memory to another.  
</p>
<p>
    A technician should have knowledge about the different RAMs that are available and they may also know what types of errors might affect a computer's RAM operation. A technician may backup all computer files before fixing RAM to avoid losing critical programs and documents.
</p>
<h3>4. Video graphics array port</h3>
<p>
    A video graphics array (VGA) port is a video input that is primarily used on PC monitors. Troubleshooting a VGA port could include verifying there isn't a loose connection, faulty cable or a broken monitor. Another task a computer technician may do is use compressed air to spray inside the VGA port to ensure it's free of dust. 
</p>
<h3>5. Power supply</h3>
<p>
    A power supply provides electricity to all components of a computer system. Typically, it's a power cord connected from the back of a PC tower into an electricity socket. A technician may troubleshoot the power supply by turning off the computer, unplugging and detaching the power supply cord or trying a new cord or outlet.
</p>
<h3>6. Cooling fan</h3>
<p>
    Cooling fans are a computer's system to decrease overheating. Many computers have more than one cooling fan to help users who run their computer heavily, such as video streaming or gaming. A computer technician may need to fix a computer's cooling fan if a user notices their computer overheating. They may check for any damage to the blades and make sure that they are free from debris. Replacing computer fans can be a common troubleshooting solution for a technician.
</p>
<h3>7. Hard drive</h3>
<p>
    Hard drives are data storage devices used to store files, programs or other information on a computer system. They use magnetically coated discs called hard disks that store digital representations of information. If a hard drive fails, a computer technician may suspect a corrupt hard drive. They may use data recovery software to repair the computer or may replace the hard drive.
</p>
<h3>8. Monitor</h3>
<p>
    A computer monitor is an electronic device that displays what's what programs are running on your computer so a user can see. Some computer technicians may wear anti-static gloves when handling computer monitors to avoid static electricity. They may also troubleshoot monitor issues by disconnecting it from the computer and trying a new power cord.
</p>
<h3>9. Printer</h3>
<p>
    This is a machine that produces copies of text or images on paper using ink. Popular printers include laser or inkjet and computer technicians may be skilled in troubleshooting issues across multiple brands and varieties. Computer technicians may service printers including verifying power is running to the machine. They may also check to see if the paper tray is full and ready for printing. Technicians might replace or refill any ink cartridges and toner.
</p>
<p>
    If the physical printer components are operating efficiently but the machine still isn't working, a technician will then troubleshoot software malfunctions that may occur in the communication between the computer and the printer. This requires more expertise to fix since it involves how the systems interact with each other rather than physical component failures on the printer itself.
</p>
<h3>10. Scanner</h3>
<p>
    A scanner is a device that digitally copies an image or and makes it available as a file for access on a computer. If a scanner malfunctions, a computer technician may remove the cover and carefully check if it has any damage. If there are no visible issues, then they may check the power connection cable. Similar to a printer, there is computer software that connects the scanner to the computer, so a technician will also verify that the software is communicating to the scanner.
</p>
<h3>11. Computer mouse</h3>
<p>
    A computer mouse can have a wire or is wireless and is an input device used to control a cursor on the computer monitor. A wired computer mouse has a cord that connects to a USB port on a computer while a wireless mouse has no physical connection with a computer system. Instead, a wireless mouse communicates using an adapter that is usually plugged into an available USB port and runs off its own batteries using Bluetooth technology.
</p>
<p>
    Computer technicians may troubleshoot computer mouse issues by ensuring it's connected properly if it has a wire. If the mouse is wireless, a technician can look to see if they need batteries and that the wireless connection is working. Computer technicians can clean both wired and wireless with cloths to ensure there is no dust or debris on the sensor on the bottom of a mouse. If there is, the mouse may not operate correctly. 
</p>
<h2>Input Device</h2>
<p>
    An input device is a term for a physical piece of hardware that connects to a primary device, such as a computer, in order to provide user input.  
</p>
<p>
    Input devices are generally a class of peripheral devices that connect to the primary device.
</p>
<p>
    Top examples include: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keyboards</li>
    <li>Mouse devices</li>
    <li>Joysticks</li>
    <li>Microphones</li>
    <li>And web cameras</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output Device</h3>
<p>
    Any peripheral that accepts data from a computer and prints, projects, or reproduces it is known as an output device. The output may be audio, video, hard copy – printed paper, etc. Output devices convert the computer data to human understandable form. 
</p>
<p>
    We give input to the computer using input devices and the computer performs operations on the data and displays the output to the user using the output device. 
</p>
<p>
    The various output devices are: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Monitor</li>
    <li>Printer</li>
    <li>Plotter</li>
    <li>Projector</li>
    <li>Speaker</li>
    <li>Headphone</li>
    <li>Sound Card</li>
    <li>Video card</li>
    <li>GPS</li>
</ul>
<h2>CPU</h2>
<p>
    CPU is an acronym for "Central Processing Unit". It is also known as the brain of the computer. CPU receives the instructions from active software and hardware. It produces the output accordingly. In addition, it stores data, instructions, and intermediate results. Thus, CPU controls the operations of all computer parts.
</p>
<p>
    CPU is installed in the motherboard on a specific area known as the CPU socket.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU) = Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU) + Control Unit (CU)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It carries out instructions and computer programs and performs all the basic arithmetic and logical operations. CPU has three major types: Transistor CPUs, Small scale integration CPU, and Large scale integration CPUs. Now, let's discuss about the parts of the CPU.
</p>
<h2>Components of CPU</h2>
<p>
    There are three components of a Central Processing Unit (CPU) that are listed as follows -

</p>
<ul>
    <li>Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU)</li>
    <li>Control Unit (CU)</li>
    <li>Memory or storage unit</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The parts of the CPU are shown in the below image -

<h2>Memory and Storage Devices</h2>
<h3>Memory Devices</h3>
<p>
    A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instruction. Computer memory is the storage space in computer where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored.  
</p>
<p>
    The memory is divided into large number of small parts. Each part is called a cell. Each location or cell has a unique address which varies from zero to memory size minus one. 
</p>
<p>
    For example if computer has 64k words, then this memory unit has 64 * 1024 = 65536 memory location. The address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535. 
</p>
<p>
    Memory is primarily of two types
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Internal Memory </strong>− cache memory and primary/main memory</li>
    <li><strong>External Memory</strong> − magnetic disk / optical disk etc</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/memory_hiearchy.jpg">
<p>
    Characteristics of Memory Hierarchy are following when we go from top to bottom
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Capacity in terms of storage increases.</li>
    <li>Cost per bit of storage decreases.</li>
    <li>Frequency of access of the memory by the CPU decreases.</li>
    <li>Access time by the CPU increases.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Storage Devices</h3>
<p>
    A storage device is a kind of hardware, which is also known as storage, storage medium, digital storage, or storage media that has the ability to store information either temporarily or permanently. Generally, it is used to hold, port, and extract data files. It can be used either internally or externally to a computer system, server or any comparable computing device to hold information.

 
</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/computer/images/what-is-a-storage-device.jpg">
<p>
    For any computing device, a storage device is one of the core components that is available in several structures and sizes on the basis of requirements and functionalities. Except for hardware firmware, it stores virtually all the data applications in a computer. A storage device is available in various form factors; for case, a computer device includes different storage media such as hard disk, RAM, cache. They also have optical disk drives and externally connected USB drives. Two types of storage devices, primary and secondary are available there to store data. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Primary storage devices:</strong>
    They are fit internally to the computer and very fast in terms of accessing data files. The RAM and cache memory are the examples of the primary storage devices.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Secondary storage devices:</strong>
    The hard disk, USB storage devices and optical disk drive are examples of secondary storage devices, which are designed to store data permanently. They include a large storage capacity while comparing with primary storage devices.
